# Codex Review Checkpoint

Code review checkpoint that runs Codex CLI review on the current worktree.

## What This Skill Does

1. Determines what to review (uncommitted changes vs branch diff)
2. Calls `codex/review` MCP tool
3. Parses results into structured format
4. Writes result to checkpoint file

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Review Scope

Check what needs reviewing:

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain

# If clean, get branch for comparison
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

### Step 2: Run Codex Review

Use the MCP tool based on scope:

```bash
# For uncommitted changes
mcp-cli call codex/review '{"uncommitted": true, "title": "Checkpoint Review"}'

# For branch diff against main
mcp-cli call codex/review '{"base": "main", "title": "Checkpoint Review"}'
```

### Step 3: Parse and Write Result

After reviewing, create a structured result:

```json
{
  "checkpoint": "codex-review",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:00:00Z",
  "passed": true,
  "issues": [],
  "needs_visual": false,
  "summary": "No critical issues found"
}
```

**Result Fields:**
- `passed`: true if no blocking issues found
- `issues`: array of `{severity: "error"|"warning"|"info", message: string, file?: string, line?: number}`
- `needs_visual`: true if UI changes detected that require visual QA
- `summary`: brief human-readable summary

### Step 4: Write Checkpoint File

Write result to `.checkpoints/codex-review.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p .checkpoints
cat > .checkpoints/codex-review.json << 'EOF'
{
  "checkpoint": "codex-review",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "passed": true,
  "issues": [],
  "needs_visual": false,
  "summary": "..."
}
EOF
```

## Decision Criteria

**Pass if:**
- No errors in review output
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- No obvious bugs or logic errors

**Fail if:**
- Security issues found
- Critical bugs detected
- Code doesn't compile/type-check

**Needs Visual QA if:**
- Changes touch UI components
- CSS/styling changes detected
- New pages or routes added

## Example Usage

When invoked as `/codex-review`:

```
Running Codex review checkpoint...

Reviewing uncommitted changes...
Found 3 modified files, 1 new file.

Calling codex/review...
Review complete. 2 suggestions, 0 errors.

Result:
{
  "passed": true,
  "issues": [
    {"severity": "info", "message": "Consider adding error handling", "file": "api.ts", "line": 45}
  ],
  "needs_visual": true,
  "summary": "Minor suggestions only. UI changes detected - visual QA recommended."
}

Checkpoint result written to .checkpoints/codex-review.json
```
